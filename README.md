# Neuro-Symbolic AI Project

This project demonstrates a simple neuro-symbolic AI system, combining symbolic reasoning with neural network modules. Inspired by the ExtensityAI/symbolicai repository, this implementation is original and provides a foundation for further research and experimentation.

## Features
- Symbolic reasoner for knowledge representation and inference
- Neural module for basic vector transformations
- Example usage integrating both symbolic and neural components

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```
3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output
```
Query sky: blue
Query grass: green
Inference: The world is colorful
Neural output: [neural vector output]
```
