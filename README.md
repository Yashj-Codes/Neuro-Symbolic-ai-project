# Neuro-Symbolic AI Project

## Overview
Neuro-symbolic AI combines the strengths of symbolic reasoning (logic, rules, knowledge bases) with neural learning (deep learning, pattern recognition). This hybrid approach enables interpretable, explainable, and robust AI systems that can reason about facts and learn from data.

## Features
- **Symbolic Reasoning:** Store, query, and infer facts using logic rules. Handle contradictions and chain multi-step reasoning.
- **Neural Learning:** Simple neural modules for prediction, training, and model persistence. Supports forward pass, activation functions, and gradient descent.
- **Hybrid Engine:** Integrates neural predictions with symbolic facts for end-to-end neuro-symbolic inference and explanations.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the demo scripts to explore each module:
```bash
# Symbolic Reasoning Demo
python demo_symbolic.py

# Neural Module Demo
python demo_neural.py

# Hybrid Engine Demo
python demo_hybrid.py
```

## Project Structure
- `symbolicai/` — Core neuro-symbolic AI modules (reasoner, neural, hybrid, utils)
- `examples/` — Example scripts and usage demos
- `tests/` — Unit tests for all major components
- `main.py` — Streamlit web UI for interactive legal reasoning

## Roadmap
- Integrate PyTorch for advanced neural models
- Add support for real-world legal and contract datasets
- Improve NLP extraction with transformer models (e.g., Legal-BERT)
- Expand symbolic rule library for more domains
- Add REST API and web deployment options
